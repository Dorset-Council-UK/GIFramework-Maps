# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a small project, so only the latest versions are supported with security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues should be reported privately, via email, to the Dorset Council GIS team gis@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk. You should receive a response within 24 hours during business days.
