GIFramework Maps is a [.NET](https://dot.net) based web mapping application designed and developed by the Dorset Council GIS team.

It is used by Dorset Council as their primary web mapping application for staff and the public. [You can see it running live here](https://gi.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk/dorsetexplorer).

GIFramework Maps is Free and Open Source software, it uses [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), as well as many other libraries, and is licensed under the MIT licence.

## Bugs

Please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Dorset-Council-UK/GIFramework-Maps/issues) for all bugs and feature requests. Before creating a new issue, do a quick search to see if the problem has been reported already.

Dorset Council staff should submit issues via the internal help desk.

## Dependencies
To run GIFramework Maps with minimal modification, you will need:
- A web server capable of running .NET applications, such as IIS, Kestrel or Azure
- PostgreSQL 13+ with PostGIS extension

GIFramework Maps uses [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/). Postgres has been set up for this project, but with some modifications, any Entity Framework Core compatible provider should work.
